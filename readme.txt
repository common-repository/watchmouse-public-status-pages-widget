== Description ==

Impress your WordPress users by transparently displaying your WatchMouse Public Status Page statistics in clear graphs on your WordPress site.

After creating a WatchMouse Public Status Page containing your website and server monitors, the plugin can use the WatchMouse API to download your monitoring results and push them to your WordPress site. Using CSS you can adjust the look and feel to match your organization's style.

The Public Status Page Widget allows your WordPress site users to view:

* The current status and response times for any published WatchMouse Public Status Page
* Uptime and response times in hourly, daily or weekly graphs
* A list of any outages

This is probably due to the hierarchy between the WatchMouse plugin's styles and styles set by your theme. Once you have identified what is causing the problem, fix it inside either assets/css/style.css or your theme's CSS file.
